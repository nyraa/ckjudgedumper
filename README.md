# ckjudge dumper
Idea from [Jimmy01240397/ckjudgedumper](https://github.com/Jimmy01240397/ckjudgedumper).  
## Requirement
This script requires following modules:
```
pip install requests markdownify
```
## Usage
```
python ckjdumper.py <YOUR_SESS_COOKIE>
```
Fill your ckjudge session cookie in, without key.  
About how to get your session cookie, you can reference Jimmy's repo.  
## Why I wrote this script that is the same function to Jimmy's
IDK, don't ask me why.
## known issues
* chapter README's image src is not correct if image from base64

<s>I think no one will read even use this repo, so I'm lazy to fix that.</s>
